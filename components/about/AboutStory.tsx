                  Direct Impact Empowerment Foundation was born out of a desire to 
                  address the challenges of unemployment and poverty in Nigeria. Our 
                  founders, led by Eka Oga Reuben, saw the immense potential in youth 
                  across Apata, Ibadan, and envisioned a future where every young person 
                  had access to meaningful opportunities.

                <p>
                  With a team of passionate professionals, we began this journey by 
                  focusing on the untapped potential in Nigeria&apos;s fashion industryâ€”a 
                  sector capable of transforming lives and contributing significantly 
                  to the economy. Today, we continue to grow, driven by our unwavering 
                  commitment to create a sustainable model for youth empowerment.
